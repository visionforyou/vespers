My soul doth mágnify the Lórd, \*  
    and my spirit hath rejoiced in Gód my Sávior.

For he hath regarded the lówliness of his hándmaiden. \*  
    For behold from henceforth all generations shall cáll me bléssed.  

For he that is mighty hath mágnified mé, \*  
    and hóly is his Náme.  

And his mercy is on thém that féar him \*  
    throughóut all generátions.  

He hath showed stréngth with his árm; \*  
    he hath scattered the proud in the imaginátion of their héarts.  

He hath put down the míghty from their séat, \*  
    and hath exalted the húmble and méek.  

He hath filled the húngry with good thíngs, \*  
    and the rich he hath sent émpty awáy.  

He remembering his mercy hath helped his sérvant Ísrael, \*  
    as he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his séed for éver.  


Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, \*  
and to the Hóly Spírit:     

as it was in the beginning, is now and éver shall bé; \*  
world withóut énd. || Amen.

Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according tó thy wórd. \*  
For mine eyes have séen thy salvátion,

## Apostles' Creed

\gregorioscore{gabc/apostles-creed}
\nopagebreak
And in Jesus Christ his only Són our Lord;  
who was conceived by the Hóly Ghost,  
born of the Vírgin Mary,  
suffered under Póntius Pilate,  
\* was crucified, déad, and buried.  

He descended ínto hell.  
The third day he rose again fróm the dead.  
He ascended ínto heaven,  
and sitteth on the right hand of God the Fathér almighty.  
\* From thence he shall come to judge the quick ánd the dead.

I believe in the Hóly Ghost,  
the holy cátholic Church,  
the communíon of saints,  
the forgivenéss of sins,  
the resurrection óf the body,  
\* and the life éverlasting.

#### of the Day

*See insert.*

#### against all Perils

Lighten our darkness,  
we beseech thee, O Lord,  
and by thy great mercy defend us  
from all the perils and dangers of this night,  
for the love of thy only Son,  
our savior Jesus Christ.  
**Amen.**


#### for this Night

Keep watch, dear Lord,  
with those who work, or watch, or weep this night,  
and give thine angels charge over those who sleep.  
Tend the sick, Lord Christ;

### The General Thanksgiving

_Sung or read by all._

Almighty God, Father of all mercies,  
we thine unworthy servants  
do give thee most humble and hearty thanks  
for all thy goodness and loving-kindness  
to us and to all people.  

We bless thee for our creation, preservation,  
and all the blessings of this life;  
but above all for thine inestimable love  
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;  
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.

And, we beseech thee,  
give us that due sense of all thy mercies,  
that our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful;  
and that we show forth thy praise,  
not only with our lips, but in our lives,  
by giving up our selves to thy service,  
and by walking before thee  
in holiness and righteousness all our days;  
through Jesus Christ our Lord,  
to whom, with thee and the Holy Spirit,  
be all honor and glory, world without end.  
**Amen.**

Almighty God,
who hast given us grace at this time, with one accord,

that when two or three are gathered together in his Name   thou wilt be in the midst of them:  

Fulfill now, O Lord,
the desires and petitions of thy servants  
as may be best for us;  
granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth,  
and in the world to come life everlasting.  
**Amen.**
