## Psalmody

### Psalm 15 --- _Domine, quis habitabit?_
\nopagebreak
\gregorioscore{gabc/tones/1}
\nopagebreak
Lord, who shall dwell in thy tábernácle? \*   
or who shall rest upon thy hóly híll?

Even he that leadeth an úncorrupt lífe, \*  
and doeth the thing which is right, \†  
and speaketh the trúth from his héart.

He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, \†  
nor done évil to his néighbour, \*  
and hath not slándered his néighbour.

He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his ówn éyes, \*  
and maketh much of them that féar the Lórd.

He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappóinteth him nót, \*  
though it were to his ówn híndrance.

He that hath not given his móney upon úsury, \*  
nor taken reward agáinst the ínnocent.

Whoso dóeth these thíngs \*  
shall néver fáll.

Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, \*  
and to the Hóly Spírit:     

as it was in the beginning, is now and éver shall bé; \*  
world withóut énd. || Amen.

### Psalm 113 --- _Laudate, pueri._

\gregorioscore{gabc/tones/0-peregrinus}
\nopagebreak
Praise the Lórd, ye sérvants; \*  
O praise the Náme of the Lórd.

Blessed be the Náme of the Lórd \*  
from this time fórth for évermore.

The Lord’s Náme is práised \*  
from the rising up of the sun unto the going dówn of the sáme.

The Lord is high abóve all nátions, \*  
and his glory abóve the héavens.

Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwélling so hígh, \*  
and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in héaven and éarth!

He taketh up the símple out of the dúst, \*  
and lifteth the póor out of the míre;

That he may set him wíth the prínces, \*  
even with the princes óf his péople.

He maketh the barren wóman to kéep house, \*  
and to be a joyful móther of chíldren.

Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, \*  
and to the Hóly Spírit:     

as it was in the beginning, is now and éver shall bé; \*  
world withóut énd. || Amen.

### Psalm 146 --- _Lauda, anima mea._
\nopagebreak
\gregorioscore{gabc/tones/1}
\nopagebreak
Praise the Lord, O my soul: \†  
while I live, will I práise the Lórd; \*  
yea, as long as I have any being, I will sing praises untó my Gód.

O put not your trust in princes, nor in any chíld of mán; \*  
for there is no hélp in thém.

For when the breath of man goeth forth, \†  
he shall turn agáin to his éarth, \*  
and then áll his thoughts pérish.

Blessed is he that hath the God of Jacob fór his hélp, \*   
and whose hope is in the Lórd his Gód:

Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that thérein ís; \*  
who keepeth his prómise for éver;

Who helpeth them to right that súffer wróng; \*  
who féedeth the húngry.

The Lord looseth mén out of príson; \*  
the Lord giveth síght to the blínd.

The Lord helpeth thém that are fállen; \*  
the Lord cáreth for the ríghteous.

The Lord careth for the strangers; \†  
he defendeth the fátherless and wídow: \*  
as for the way of the ungodly, he turneth it úpside dówn.

The Lord thy God, O Sion, shall be King for évermóre, \*  
and throughóut all generátions.

Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, \*  
and to the Hóly Spírit:     

as it was in the beginning, is now and éver shall bé; \*  
world withóut énd. || Amen.

## Lessons

### Wisdom 5:1-16

Then shall the just stand with great constancy against those that have afflicted them, and taken away their labours. These seeing it, shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the suddenness of their unexpected salvation. Saying within themselves, repenting, and groaning for anguish of spirit: These are they, whom we had some time in derision, and for a parable of reproach. We fools esteemed their life madness, and their end without honour. Behold how they are numbered among the children of God, and their lot is among the saints. Therefore we have erred from the way of truth, and the light of justice hath not shined unto us, and the sun of understanding hath not risen upon us.

### 1 Peter 5:1-4

The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech, who am myself also an ancient, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:

Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint, but willingly, according to God, not for filthy lucre's sake, but voluntarily; Neither as lording it over the clergy, but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart. And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.

_The Canticle of Simeon follows the lesson._

## Collect of the Day

Heavenly Father,
who didst send thine Apostle Paul to preach the gospel,
and gavest him Timothy and Titus
to be his companions in the faith:

grant that, through their prayers,
our fellowship in the Holy Spirit
may bear witness to the name of Jesus;

who liveth and reigneth with thee,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

**Amen.**
