### Psalm 1 --- _Beatus vir_

Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, \†  
nor stood in the wáy of sínners \*  
and hath not sat in the séat of the scórnful.

But his delight is in the láw of the Lórd \*  
and in his law will he exercise himself dáy and night.

And he shall be like a tree plánted by the wáter-side \*  
that will bring forth his frúit in due séason.

His leaf also sháll not wíther \*  
and look, whatsoever he doeth, ít shall prósper.

As for the ungodly, it is not só with thém \*  
but they are like the chaff,  
which the wind scattereth away from the fáce of the éarth.

Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stánd in the júdgement \*  
neither the sinners in the congregátion of the ríghteous.

But the Lord knoweth the wáy of the ríghteous \*  
and the way of the ungódly shall pérish.

Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, \*  
and to the Hóly Spírit:     

as it was in the beginning, is now and éver shall bé; \*  
world without énd. Amén.

_The weekly antiphon is repeated._

### Psalm 82 --- _Deus stetit_

God standeth in the congregátion of prínces; \*  
he is a Júdge among góds.

How long will ye gíve wrong júdgment, \*  
and accept the pérsons of the ungódly?

Defend the póor and fátherless; \*  
see that such as are in need and necéssity have ríght.

Deliver the óutcast and póor; \*  
save them from the hánd of the ungódly.

They know not, neither do they understand, \†  
but walk on stíll in dárkness: \*  
all the foundations of the earth are óut of cóurse.

I have said, Yé are góds, \*  
and ye are all the children óf the Most Híghest.

But ye shall díe like mén, \*  
and fall like óne of the prínces.

Arise, O God, and júdge thou the éarth; \*  
for thou shalt take all nations to thíne inhéritance.

Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, \*  
and to the Hóly Spírit:     

as it was in the beginning, is now and éver shall bé; \*  
world without énd. Amén.

_The weekly antiphon is repeated._

### Psalm 148 --- _Laudate Dominum_

O Praise the Lórd from the héavens: \*  
praise him ín the héights.

Praise him, all ye ángels of hís: \*  
praise him, áll his hóst.

Praise him, sún and móon: \*  
praise him, all ye stárs and líght.

Praise him, áll ye héavens, \*  
and ye waters that are abóve the héavens.

Let them praise the Name of the Lord: \†  
for he spake the word, and théy were máde; \*  
he commanded, and théy were creáted.

He hath made them fast for éver and éver: \*  
he hath given them a law which sháll not be bróken.

Praise the Lórd from the éarth, \*  
ye drágons and all déeps;

Fire and hail, snów and vápours, \*  
wind and storm, fulfílling his wórd;

Mountains and áll hílls; \*  
fruitful trees and áll cédars;

Beasts and áll cáttle; \*  
creeping things and flýing fówls;

Kings of the earth, and áll péoples; \*  
princes, and all júdges of the wórld;

Young men and maidens, óld men and chíldren, \*  
praise the Náme of the Lórd:

for his Name ónly is éxcellent, \*  
and his praise above héaven and éarth.

He shall exalt the horn of his people: \†  
all his sáints shall práise him; \*  
even the children of Israel, even the péople that sérveth him.

Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, \*  
and to the Hóly Spírit:     

as it was in the beginning, is now and éver shall bé; \*  
world without énd. Amén.

## Lesson

_One of the following is read or sung._

### Workshop 0 --- Romans 12:1-2

My brothers, I implore you by God’s mercy to offer your very selves to him: a living sacrifice, dedicated and fit for his acceptance, the worship offered by mind and heart. Adapt yourselves no longer to the pattern of this present world, but let your minds be remade and your whole nature thus transformed. Then you will be able to discern the will of God, and to know what is good, acceptable, and perfect.

### Workshop 1 --- James 2:14-20

Of what use is it, my brethren, if a man claims to have faith, and has no deeds to shew for it? Can faith save him then? Here is a brother, here is a sister, going naked, left without the means to secure their daily food; if one of you says to them, Go in peace, warm yourselves and take your fill, without providing for their bodily needs, of what use is it? Thus faith, if it has no deeds to shew for itself, has lost its own principle of life. Thou believest that there is only one God; that is well enough, but then, so do the devils, and the devils shrink from him in terror. Rash soul, wouldst thou be assured that faith without deeds to shew has no life in it? Body separated from spirit is a dead body; faith separated from good works is a dead faith.

### Workshop 2 --- 1 Peter 2:18-25

Slaves must be respectful and obedient to their masters, not only when they are kind and gentle but also when they are unfair. You see, there is some merit in putting up with the pains of unearned punishment if it is done for the sake of God but there is nothing meritorious in taking a beating patiently if you have done something wrong to deserve it. The merit, in the sight of God, is in bearing it patiently when you are punished after doing your duty.


### Workshop 3 --- James 1:19-22

You know this, my beloved brethren, well enough. It is for us men to be ready listeners, slow to speak our minds, slow to take offence; man’s anger does not bear the fruit that is acceptable to God. Rid yourselves, then, of all defilement, of all the ill-will that remains in you; be patient, and cherish that word implanted in you which can bring salvation to your souls.

### Workshop 4 --- John 15:11-12, 16

All this I have told you so that my joy may be yours and the measure of your joy may be filled up. This is my commandment, that you should love one another as I have loved you.

It was not you that chose me, it was I that chose you. The task I have appointed you is to go out and bear fruit, fruit that will endure; so that every request that you make of the Father in my name may be granted you.


### Workshop 5 --- _from "Explanation of Ecclesiastes," St. Gregory of Agrigentum_

Now it is our supreme delight to behold him and contemplate his divine splendor with the eyes of our spirit. When we participate in and associate with that beauty, we are filled with a joy that comes from God and endures through all the days of our earthly life.

In the wise words of Ecclesiastes: A man may live for many years, but he will experience happiness throughout his days. For all who gaze upon the Sun of Justice, he is their supreme delight.  

### Workshop 6 --- 2 Maccabees 12:43-46

Then he would have contribution made; a sum of twelve thousand silver pieces he levied, and sent it to Jerusalem, to have sacrifice made there for the guilt of their dead companions. Was not this well done and piously? Here was a man kept the resurrection ever in mind; he had done fondly and foolishly indeed, to pray for the dead, if these might rise no more, that once were fallen! And these had made a godly end; could he doubt, a rich recompense awaited them? A holy and wholesome thought it is to pray for the dead, for their guilt’s undoing.

### Workshop 7 --- 1 Peter 1:5-9

Through your faith, God’s power will guard you until the salvation which has been prepared is revealed at the end of time. This is a cause of great joy for you, even though you may for a short time have to bear being plagued by all sorts of trials; so that, when Jesus Christ is revealed, your faith will have been tested and proved like gold – only it is more precious than gold, which is corruptible even though it bears testing by fire – and then you will have praise and glory and honour. You did not see him, yet you love him; and still without seeing him, you are already filled with a joy so glorious that it cannot be described, because you believe; and you are sure of the end to which your faith looks forward, that is, the salvation of your souls.


### Workshop 8 --- John 15:7-11

If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will and it shall be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me so I have loved you; continue in my love. If you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love. Even as I have kept the Father’s commandments and abide in His love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.

My soul doth mágnify the Lórd, \*  
    and my spirit hath rejoiced in Gód my Sávior.

For he hath regarded the lówliness of his hándmaiden. \*  
    For behold from henceforth all generations shall cáll me bléssed.  

For he that is mighty hath mágnified mé, \*  
    and hóly is his Náme.  

And his mercy is on thém that féar him \*  
    throughóut all generátions.  

He hath showed stréngth with his árm; \*  
    he hath scattered the proud in the imaginátion of their héarts.  

He hath put down the míghty from their séat, \*  
    and hath exalted the húmble and méek.  

He hath filled the húngry with good thíngs, \*  
    and the rich he hath sent émpty awáy.  

He remembering his mercy hath helped his sérvant Ísrael, \*  
    as he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his séed for éver.  


Glory be to the Father, and tó the Són, \*  
and to the Hóly Spírit:     

as it was in the beginning, is now and éver shall bé; \*  
world without énd. Amén.

## Apostles' Creed

\gregorioscore{gabc/apostles-creed}

And in Jesus Christ his only Són our Lord;  
who was conceived by the Hóly Ghost,  
born of the Vírgin Mary,  
suffered under Póntius Pilate,  
\* was crucified, déad, and buried.  

He descended ínto hell.  
The third day he rose again fróm the dead.  
He ascended ínto heaven,  
and sitteth on the right hand of God the Fathér almighty.  
\* From thence he shall come to judge the quick ánd the dead.

I believe in the Hóly Ghost,  
the holy cátholic Church,  
the communíon of saints,  
the forgivenéss of sins,  
the resurrection óf the body,  
\* and the life éverlasting.

Fulfill now, O Lord,
the desires and petitions of thy servants  
as may be best for us;  
granting us in this world knowledge of thy truth,  
and in the world to come life everlasting.  
**Amen.**
